## **Requirements**

To run the project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.10
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- Access to the Clash Royale API (API key required)

---

## **Setup**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Clash-Royale-Project.git
   cd Clash-Royale-Project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your Clash Royale API key:
   - Obtain an API key from the official [Clash Royale API website](https://developer.clashroyale.com/).
   - Add the API key to an environment file (`.env`) in the following format:
     ```
     CLASH_ROYALE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

---

## **Running the Scripts**

### 1. Fetching Data
Run the script to fetch battle data:
```bash
python scripts/fetch_data.py
```

### 2. Cleaning and Processing Data
Clean and preprocess the fetched JSON data into a tabular format:
```bash
python scripts/process_data.py
```

### 3. Building Predictive Models (Optional)
Train machine learning models for match prediction:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

---

## **Usage and Overview**

1. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, visualize player performance, and analyze match outcomes.

2. **Prediction Models**  
   - Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict match outcomes.
   - Evaluate models with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

3. **Customize for Advanced Analytics**  
   Extend the project to analyze trends, player strategies, or build real-time dashboards for game insights.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Model Deployment:** Deploy predictive models as a web application or API for real-time match predictions.
- **Data Visualization:** Add more visualizations to highlight key insights from the data.
- **Additional Features:** Analyze card effectiveness, player deck compositions, and opponent strategies.
